This is the final source code for the final PROGRAMMING II Java - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING course, with professor [Reza Salchian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reza-shalchian-70177b94/) ðŸ”—.

This course main focus was Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The main focus was OOP basic principles such as Classes, their design and implementation, constructors, try-catch clauses, and exceptions. we also explored Java Collection classes, for-each loops, text file input-output and network connectivity.
